# ORE-LEVEL-ONE
Mine ORE at lowest difficulty gamble vs 0x1. (User results will vary error %, use at own risk)

I realized making ASIC files public after HARDHATCHAD changing his tune about mining pools after I stated I had a front end package in my CUDA-ORE-DUMP release
Would definetely kill all small miners and bring more control to these traders larping as miners. See how fast they have shifted to GPU and such after being exposed.
The source code now being OPEN SOURCE and available to the public has shortened their timespan to backdoor you all. They now have no advanatge over you besides length of time being ahead.

But I don't dissapoint, I'm here to bring the power back to the small miners but at a small risk.

The ORE code is not correct for mining, luckily this wasn't a real blockchain or it would have been destroyed.

You can mine at lowest difficulty at "0" priority fees if good RPC. "Under 100k" at Alchemy free, no CC required, most disposable emails work. 

THE RISK IS 0X1 ERRORS FOR THE FINAL CHECK ONCHAIN, IF YOU SPAM "0" PRIORITY FEES THIS CAN STILL GIVE YOU AN EDGE DEPENDING ON ORE/SOL PRICE. 
ITS NOT A PERFECT OPTION BUT IT IS AN OPTION WHERE YOU CAN DECIDE SAVE YOUR HARDWARE AND MINE FAST, OR WASTE VALUABLE RESOURCES MINE SLOW AND STILL GAMBLE 0X3 ERRORS

Priority FEE is not an issue, the Code is the issue as many real developers have stated. The random function is not correct and that is why the miners spam hash already validated or send anyway for 0x3.

Don't be manipulated to pay more than what everyone else truly is. Over time priority fees will hit into your margins, they know this and want you to spend 5 million, 10 million for priority fees. 

Demand they fix their code and quit misinformation.

EASY PEASY
1. replace file
2. save power, compute resources, and gamble your luck!
3. hopefully WIN
